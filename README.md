## Parametric Rugged Case with toggle latch
Yet another rugged case parametric design.

What makes this design special it that it has a really well-tuned toggle latch that can easily be assembled with a few M3 screws.



## Bill of Materials

To assemble the rugged case, you will need the following items:

- 2 x M3x25 screws (default length for toggle latches)
- 1 x M3x16 screw (default length for toggle latches)
- 2 x M3x20 screws (default length for hinges)

Note: The default screw lengths can be customized to fit your specific needs.


## Customization
To customize the rugged case design, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the rugged-case.scad file and update the config overrides according to your needs.
3. Save the changes and run `make all` in the terminal. This command will generate all the STL files and save them to the `stl` directory. Make sure you have openscad installed.

The parts can also be generated with the Thingiverse customizer.
