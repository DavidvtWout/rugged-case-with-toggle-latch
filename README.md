Work in progress! Will probably be ready in a week or so.

## rugged case with toggle latch
Yet another rugged case parametric design.

What makes this design special it that it has a really well-tuned toggle latch that can easily be assembled with a few M3 screws.

The openscad files will be uploaded to Thingiverse where the customizer can be used.
